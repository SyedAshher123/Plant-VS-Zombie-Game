# Plant-VS-Zombie-Game
Description:

The Plants vs Zombies Game Clone is a recreation of the popular tower defense game, created using C++ and the SFML library. This project leverages pointers and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, making it an excellent example of intermediate C++ programming. Despite using advanced concepts, the project does not use the Standard Template Library (STL).

Features:

1. Classic Gameplay: Defend your garden from waves of zombies using various plants.
2. Challenging Levels: Progress through increasingly difficult waves of zombies.
3. Interactive Environment: Different types of plants and zombies with unique abilities.

Controls:

Gather Suns: Use the left mouse button to gather suns, which act as currency.

Select and Place Plants: Click on any card to select it if you have enough suns, and then click on any box in the grid to place the plant in that box.
